            We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site,
            especially when conducting business. This statement governs our
            privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site
            (“Visitors”) who visit without transacting business and Visitors who
            register to transact business on the Site and make use of the
            various services offered by ACC Management Group (collectively,
            “Services”) (“Authorized Customers”).

          <p>
            <b>“Personally Identifiable Information”</b> refers to any
            information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or
            locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but
            not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email
            address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card
            information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include
            information that is collected anonymously (that is, without
            identification of the individual user) or demographic information
            not connected to an identified individual.

            What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We may collect basic user profile information from all of our
            Visitors. We collect the following additional information from our
            Authorized Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email
            addresses of Authorized Customers.

            What organizations are collecting the information?
          </h4>
          <p>
            In addition to our direct collection of information, our third-party
            service vendors such as credit card companies who may provide such
            services as credit, may collect this information from our Visitors
            and Authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties
            use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use
            personal information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized
            Customers.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-secondary mt-3">
            How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to
            make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and
            selling requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized
            Customers about purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or
            information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also
            use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and
            Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries or to provide
            requested information.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-secondary mt-3">
            How is Personally Identifiable Information stored?
          </h4>
          <p>

            Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out of receiving
            unsolicited information from or being contacted by us by responding

            Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain
            information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services
            they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect
            our Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is
            logged on and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will
            automatically log the Authorized Customer off.
          </p>

            Identifiable Information when reasonably necessary to protect the
            safety of our Visitors and Authorized Customers.

          <h4 class="text-secondary mt-3">
            How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?
          </h4>
          <p>
            All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and
            practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors
            and Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number of
            qualified employees who are given a password in order to gain access
            to the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a
            regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers,
            is protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect
            information sent over the Internet. While we take commercially
            reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic
            communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering, and
            break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will
            not take place and we will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized
            Customers for any such occurrences.

            What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?
          </h4>
          <p>
            We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes
            to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However,
            if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause
            disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or
            Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we
            will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such
            Visitor or Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.
