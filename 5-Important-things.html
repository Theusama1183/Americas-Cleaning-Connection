            <p>
              If you've been thinking of hiring a commercial cleaning service,
              this guide will show you how to avoid many of the common mistakes
              property owners and managers make. The cleaning industry is one of
              the few unregulated industries,and it is easy to get into. Because
              of this, there is little assurance that you are getting a
              truly"professional" commercial cleaning service. In order to
              protect your business, your property and your employees, there are
              5 things you should know before letting a janitorial worker into
              your business.

            <h2 class="text-primary">The Truth About Sub-Contractors</h2>
            <p>
              You may be thinking about hiring a cleaning company that offers
              the lowest price, which at ﬁrst seems great because it will save
              you money. And after all, who doesn't want to cut their business
              expense budget? What you may not realize though, is there are a
              few commercial cleaning companies in your community who pay their
              workers illegally because they classify the workers as
              "sub-contractors". This gives them a cost advantage over
              professional cleaning companies who hire their workers as
              employees, following IRS guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a company hires a worker as a sub-contractor, the employee is
              expected to carry the tax burden normally paid by an employer,
              including employment taxes, Social Security taxes, Medicare, and
              Unemployment taxes. In addition, the sub- contractor is
              responsible for their own Worker's Compensation insurance,
              liability insurance, bond and even equipment. The problem is, 99%
              of these workers do not even know they are responsible for these
              expenses because they are being treated as an employee in the eyes
              of the IRS.

              Cleaning companies who hire workers illegally have questionable

              want to steer clear of them.

            <p class="text-center text-white">
              It is very important to ask questions about insurance coverage.
              Never hire a cleaning company that does not have insurance. You
              can avoid costly mistakes by hiring a company that has insurance
              to protect your business and the property within the building in
              case of damage or injuries to the cleaners while they are on your
              property.
              <br /><br />
              Make sure they have liability insurance, bonding, and Worker's
              Compensation coverage. Ask the cleaning company for proof of
              insurance. The cleaning company can ask their insurance company to
              fax, email, or mail a copy of the certiﬁcate of insurance to you.
              Every reputable cleaning company will be happy to provide proof of
              insurance. This will give you peace of mind every time your
              business is cleaned.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Building Walk-Through</h2>
            <p>
              It is important that you have a face-to-face interview and
              walk-through with the cleaning company. Take note of their
              appearance; are they well-dressed or in a uniform? Is the vehicle
              they are driving clean and have advertising for their company? Are
              they gathering information, taking notes, measuring and asking
              questions?
              <br /><br />
              It is important to walk through your building so the cleaning
              company can see the different types of surfaces they will be
              cleaning and their condition. They need to know how to clean
              certain surfaces such as 0marble or granite floors and
              countertops, because not knowing how to clean those items can lead
              to costly property damage.
              <br /><br />
              As you walk-through the building, see if they wipe their hand
              across surfaces or make comments about the current cleaning
              service. A professional company would not do that.
              <br /><br />
              You should have a list of specifications for services at your
              location that are broken down into daily, weekly, monthly, and
              annual tasks. If you don't have a list of specifications, the
              contractor should have one or offer to generate a customized list
              for your location.

            <p class="mt-4">
              Ask about the supplies and equipment the cleaning company uses. Do
              they use upright vacuums or back pack vacuums? Many companies use
              a combination of both, but back pack vacuums are the industry
              standard for increased productivity. Most also have Hepa
              ﬁltration, which helps to keep dust down and particles from
              becoming airborne.
              <br /><br />
              What cleaning chemicals do they use? Many conventional cleaners
              can be harmful to janitorial workers and building employees so
              most cleaning companies are switching to more environmentally
              friendly products that work as well as conventional cleaners.

              Do they use feather dusters, static dusters or microﬁber cloths?
            </h5>
            <p>
              Microfiber cloths pick up dust and soil rather than moving it
              around or making it airborne the way feather dusters and static
              dusters do.

            Ask to see their MSDS Sheets. Cleaning companies are required to
            carry Material Safety Data Sheets on all cleaning chemicals they
            use. If they do not provide them to their employees or do not know
            what they are, consider this a big red ﬂag. Legally compliant
            companies care about the safety of their employees and customers,
            and providing training and MSDS Sheets are part of their normal
            operating procedures.
